# Abstract
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are important for targeted cancer therapy, particularly in cancers driven by EGFR-activating mutations. Many of these inhibitors function by forming covalent bonds with the Cys797 residue in the kinase domain. However, clinical resistance frequently emerges despite therapeutic drug levels. In this study, we investigated two mechanisms that may contribute to reduced long-term efficacy: oxidative modification of Cys797, which limits covalent bond formation, and EGFR protein turnover, which replenishes active receptor populations. Building on the kinetic framework proposed by Schwartz et al. (2014), we implemented two extensions to the authorsâ€™ ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to capture these phenomena. The first incorporates a time-dependent degradation term to simulate receptor recycling and resynthesis. The second introduces reversible oxidation of Cys797, modeled as a dynamic equilibrium between reduced and oxidized cysteine states. Simulations demonstrate that both mechanisms significantly reduce effective inhibition over time, with oxidation creating transient reversibility and turnover allowing recovery of signaling capacity. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating biochemical reversibility and protein dynamics in evaluating inhibitor potency. Future modeling efforts should integrate these features to improve the predictive accuracy of drug efficacy models and guide design of more robust EGFR-targeted therapies.

# Extended model
The file project.m can be used to produce the plots and simulations from Ghita et al.'s (2022) paper. The proposed system is shown in the figure below. The first two blocks describe the immunotherapy, and chemotherapy (anti-angiogenesis) dose response curves over time in days. An equivalent figure is produced from the second block for radiotherapy.
